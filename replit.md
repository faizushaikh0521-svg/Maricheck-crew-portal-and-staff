The system provides a dual-interface design with public-facing registration forms for crew members and shore-based staff, along with an admin dashboard for managing applications, tracking status, and document handling. The platform serves as a comprehensive maritime workforce management solution connecting seafarers and shore staff with shipping companies.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Template Engine**: Jinja2 templating with Flask for server-side rendering and dynamic content
- **UI Framework**: Bootstrap 5 with dark theme integration and responsive design patterns
- **Styling**: Custom maritime-themed CSS with navy blue, sea green, and gold color scheme using Inter font family
- **Icons**: Font Awesome 6.4.0 for consistent iconography throughout the application
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Bootstrap grid system and custom breakpoint handling
- **Form Handling**: Client-side validation with Flask-WTF integration and file upload previews

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Flask web framework with modular route organization and blueprint-ready structure
- **Database ORM**: SQLAlchemy with declarative base model architecture supporting both SQLite and PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login for session-based admin authentication with simple username/password system
- **Form Processing**: Flask-WTF with comprehensive validation, CSRF protection, and file upload handling
- **File Management**: Secure file upload system with UUID-based naming, organized folder structure, and file type validation
- **Security**: Werkzeug password hashing for admin credentials and ProxyFix middleware for deployment

### Data Storage Architecture
- **Primary Database**: SQLAlchemy ORM with SQLite default (production-ready for PostgreSQL migration)
- **Models**: Three core entities - Admin (authentication), CrewMember (seafarer profiles), and StaffMember (shore-based positions)
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem with organized directory structure under static/uploads with categorized subfolders
- **Status Management**: Enumerated status system (Registered, Screening, Documents Verified, Approved, Rejected, Flagged)
- **Data Validation**: Field-level constraints with unique passport numbers for crew members

### Key Architectural Decisions
- **Dual Interface Separation**: Public registration portal and protected admin dashboard serve different user needs without role complexity
- **Session-Based Authentication**: Simple admin login without complex user role management, suitable for small to medium operations
- **File Upload Strategy**: Local file storage with UUID prefixes for security, organized by document type (passport, CDC, resume, photo, medical)
- **Database Agnostic Design**: SQLite for development with straightforward PostgreSQL production migration path
- **Form-Centric Design**: Heavy emphasis on form processing with comprehensive validation and user feedback
- **Status Tracking System**: Centralized application status management with visual indicators and filtering capabilities
